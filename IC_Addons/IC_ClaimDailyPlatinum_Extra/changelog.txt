 2  November 2024 - v0.0.7
 - Changed the way the timers work to avoid drift.
23   October 2024 - v0.0.6
 - Adding support for automatically revealing the weekly offers to minimise their time drift (since their 7 day clock doesn't start until after they've been revealed).
23   October 2024 - v0.0.5
 - Attempting yet another further fix that will prevent large values for days claimed and yet never actually claiming.
20   October 2024 - v0.0.4
 - Fixed a few bugs caused by typos.
 - Added a slight delay to checking for the updated cooldown after a successful claim.
 - Removed redundant code.
19   October 2024 - v0.0.3
 - Fixed (hopefully) a bug where ClaimDailyPlatinum and PotionSustain would be incompatible.
19   October 2024 - v0.0.2
 - Adding a little bit of sanity checking when sending server calls.
 - Renaming a variable because I realised it might be overwriting a global of the same name.
18   October 2024 - v0.0.1
 - An add on that will claim your daily platinum automagically so you don't have to.
