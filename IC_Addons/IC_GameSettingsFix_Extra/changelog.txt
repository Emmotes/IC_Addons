23    August 2025 - v0.2.4
 - Removing the NeverOpenActiveTasks settings. It has been removed from the game as of v631.
12    August 2025 - v0.2.3
 - Changed the x10 and x25 swap mode to swap x25 and x100 instead. (And reset x10 to default.)
11    August 2025 - v0.2.2
 - Moved Hotkeys to their own section.
 - Added an option for swapping x10 and x25 hotkeys. It will only change them if the option is ticked.
 8    August 2025 - v0.2.1
 - Adding support for Mission-Critical-script-required hotkeys.
 6    August 2025 - v0.2.0
 - Mostly rebuilt this addon from the ground up to fix the game settings just before the game loads - rather than on a 1 second timer (which was starting to be too short for some people).
 - This is Script Hub v.4.0.0/v4.0.1 agnostic.
 - For other addon creators - this Overrides OpenIC().
 5    August 2025 - v0.1.12
 - Properly sharing settings with the BrivGemFarm.
 3    August 2025 - v0.1.11
 - Fixing positions of the profile buttons that were messy in some situations.
22      July 2025 - v0.1.10
 - (Hopefully) Fixed issue with not finding settings file for the people using Legendary/Rare.
22      July 2025 - v0.1.9
 - Slightly changed logic so non-EGS platforms don't need to have the game open to find the settings file.
26      June 2025 - v0.1.8
 - Changed how the addon finds the settings file with Irisiri's edit.
29   January 2025 - v0.1.7
 - Changing default LevelupAmountIndex to x100 because more people use Level Up addon than don't. And everyone *should* be using the Level Up addon.

25   October 2024 - v0.1.5

 - Added support for detecting if the game settings file is read-only.
16 September 2024 - v0.1.2

 - Changed the Settings File Location text into a list view so it can scroll.
26    August 2024 - v0.1.0

11      July 2024 - v0.0.5
 - Some very minor optimisation improvements.
10      July 2024 - v0.0.4

10      July 2024 - v0.0.2
