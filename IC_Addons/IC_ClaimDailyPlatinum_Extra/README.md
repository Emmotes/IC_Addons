# Claim Daily Platinum Addon

This is a very simple AddOn that can claim your free daily Platinum automagically so you don't have to. It can also claim free weekly shop offers.

> [!WARNING]
> *If the addon has claimed the daily platinum - and then you purchase the Daily Boost - you will need to claim the boost for that day manually. The addon will be able to claim the boost with all future days.*

## Claim Daily Platinum

The first section of the addon determines whether the script will try to claim the daily Platinum.

The timer for it is initialised to check 1 minute after starting the Gem Farm script - and it will check again whenever the server says it will be ready (+30 seconds for safety).

> [!NOTE]
> *This setting is on by default.*

## Claim Free Weekly Shop Offers

The second section determines whether the script will try to claim any free weekly shop offers.

The timer for it is initialised to check 1 minute after starting the Gem Farm script - and it will check again whenever the server says it will be ready (+30 seconds for safety).

> [!NOTE]
> *This setting is off by default because some people may occasionally wish to reroll their offers.*
