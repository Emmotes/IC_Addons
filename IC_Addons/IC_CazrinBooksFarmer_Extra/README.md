# Cazrin Books Farmer

This is an addon that will use a specialisation potion on Cazrin once she has very nearly maximum books. In doing so it'll drop her max down and back up again so you can get more books.

This is ideally used after having reached z2501 in `Cold as Ice` in `Icewind Dale` so that her cap is 1500 with her `Lost in the Library` specialisation.  
You would then drop down to z50 to farm the 8 Gelatinous Cube bosses - who each have a chance to drop a book.
